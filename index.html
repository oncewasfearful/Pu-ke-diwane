        <p class="p2">Arceus ke time and space create karnese bhi pehle, before Mew made life into the void… there existed a force beyond Pokémon, beyond common hoomans(mortals), GUardians watched over the stars, hidden in the folds of dimensions where no Ultra Wormhole could reach(somewhat similar to interstellar wala dimension).
            5 GODS lived named as

        <p class="p3">When The world became chaos they couldn't stop themselves from participating directly in the world matters,though they are gods there still is a limit to their powers their real body were too much for the pokemon world to handle so they had to choose their representers and those representers were then directly controlled by the GODS </p>
       <p class="p4"> Clumzy the God chose zerora as his representer, Dev the GOD chose venasaur, Samar the God chose zacian, Tharki the God chose Tyranitar and Fear the God chose Scizor as their representer.

        THus the Legend OF GOD SQUAD was Born, the guardians of the cosmos.</p>
